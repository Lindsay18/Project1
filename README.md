## Design
#### Colour Options
The main colours that I used came from a colour palatte of shades of Blue ![#29cde2] ![#294d61] and darker Grey 1[#191d23] I am attempting to reach a mindful audience that shows masculine side with tranqulity as well.

#### Typography
I used three fonts on this Website **Kreon** **Gloria Hallelujah** and **Ubunto** to show a playful font that catches the users eye.

#### Imagery
The images that I used on this website used from (<https://www.pexels.com/>) were all selected for the user to see various Skateboarding tricks. Some oldschool and some new. The hope is that the user would desire learning more about skateboarding and get involved.


## Testing
This site has been tested on various browsers including FireFox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge. It has also been tested on an Ipad and Mobile Phones to ensure the navigation bar works correctly. 
On Home page on smaller devices, the middle picture gets rather small. Tried various attempts to correct and was not successful. I will work on this for the future.
On the Gallery page I attempted to make each picture stand out by creating a blur effect. I realised that I made an error by including all <img> in one <div>. When attempting to correct this, I ran into further difficulties and was unable to fix.

## Validator Testing
HTML- there were initial errors when validating mainly correcting my closing tags. When moving my closing tags closer, this fixed any errors on the validator. [W3C Validator]
CSS- the errors that are on my CSS were due to using negavtive values, I was unaware that negavtive values were not to be used. I was concerned how this would effect my page if I tried to fix it. ![here](https://github.com/Lindsay18/StreetSkater/blob/main/assets/images/CSSvalidation.png) ![here](https://github.com/Lindsay18/StreetSkater/blob/main/assets/images/HTMLvalidation.jpg.png)
