          <p>
            Stoke Plaza is a huge all concrete course that was built in 2010.

            this is a must visit. There are endless numbers of lines that can be
            hit here and a lot of space between obstacles to adjust between

          <p>
            Opened in June 2013 it is now the centre of the skate scene in
            Brighton and for good reason. The street section holds everything
            that a street skater could possibly need and features banks, hips,
            stair sets, rails, kickers, flat and curved ledges, a pyramid, a
            pole jam and some pretty unique contours that you will struggle to
            find anywhere else.
